# What is this about?
- This is the collection of my JAVA practice with 50+ problems.
- Each concept has some questions. 
- All questions are divided into 5 parts with 10 questions each.

## Assignment 1
 *Basic Concepts, Data Types, Loops, Branching, Array, Command Line Args*
- Q1. Write a Java program to check whether a number is even or odd using if-else.
- Q2. Create a program to take a number from the command line and display its multiplication table using a for loop.
- Q3. Write a Java program to find the largest of three numbers using nested if-else.
- Q4. Develop a program to reverse a given number using a while loop.
- Q5. Write a program to accept n integers in an array and print only even numbers.
- Q6. Implement a program to sort an array of integers in ascending order using a loop.
- Q7. Write a program to count the number of vowels, consonants, digits, and special characters in a given string.
- Q8. Accept an integer array and find the maximum and minimum values.
- Q9. Write a program using a switch statement to create a simple calculator.
- Q10. Create a Java program to accept and display command-line arguments in reverse order.

## Assignment 2
*Class, Object, Abstract Class, Constructors*
- Q1. Define a class Employee with attributes id, name, salary and create multiple objects to display details.
- Q2. Create a class with parameterized, default, and copy constructors.
- Q3. Implement a class Student that contains a constructor to initialize name, roll number, and grade.
- Q4. Demonstrate the use of static variables and methods inside a class.
- Q5. Create an abstract class Shape with an abstract method area() and concrete method display(). Extend it in Circle and Rectangle.
- Q6. Show the use of this and super keywords with constructors in base and derived classes.
- Q7. Create a class Car with constructor overloading and method to display vehicle information.

*Inheritance and Types of Inheritance*
- Q8. Write a program to implement single inheritance using Person → Student.
- Q9. Demonstrate multilevel inheritance using classes Animal → Mammal → Human.
- Q10. Implement hierarchical inheritance where a base class Shape has subclasses Square, Rectangle, and Triangle.

## Assignment 3
- Q1. Show how constructor chaining works in multilevel inheritance.
- Q2. Explain and demonstrate the limitation of multiple inheritance in Java using classes.
- Q3. Write a program to show hybrid inheritance using interface and classes.

*Polymorphism & Types of Polymorphism*
- Q4. Write a program to show compile-time polymorphism (method overloading).
- Q5. Write a program to demonstrate runtime polymorphism using Animal and its subclasses with method overriding.
- Q6. Show how method resolution occurs in case of overridden methods and dynamic method dispatch.
- Q7. Implement a scenario where polymorphism is used to calculate the salary of different types of employees (Manager, Clerk,
Salesperson).

*Method Overloading & Method Overriding*
- Q8. Create a class with multiple versions of calculateArea() (for circle, square, rectangle).
- Q9. Override the toString() method in a user-defined class Book.
- Q10. Show how method overriding works when superclass reference is used to call a subclass method.

## Assignment 4
- Q1. Demonstrate the difference between method overloading and overriding in a single program.

*Interface*
- Q2. Define an interface Printable and implement it in classes Book and Magazine.
- Q3. Create an interface Bank with method getRateOfInterest() and implement it in SBI, ICICI, and Axis.
- Q4. Write a program to show how multiple inheritance is achieved using interfaces.

*Package, Access Modifiers*
- Q5. Create a user-defined package utility with a class MathTools that has methods for factorial and prime check.
- Q6. Demonstrate the use of all access modifiers (private, default, protected, public) in a package structure.
- Q7. Create two packages: pack1 with class A, and pack2 with class B that imports A and uses its members accordingly.

*Multithreading & Ways to Implement It*
- Q8. Write a program to create a thread by extending the Thread class and display current thread info.
- Q9. Write a program to implement a thread using the Runnable interface.
- Q10. Create two threads: one to print even numbers and another to print odd numbers up to 50.
- Q11. Create a program to demonstrate thread synchronization for a banking application (deposit and withdraw).
